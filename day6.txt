###########################################################

Evolutionary digital modeling
===========

For the first portion of the evolutionary digital modeling (EDM) classes, we will go over what EDMs are and why they are used. Several experts who use EDMs in their research will give brief introductions to the three major levels of EDMs.

`evolutionary game theory <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory>`__

`Arend Hintze <http://alproductions.us/>`__ will be giving a 30-minute introduction to `evolutionary game theory <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory>`__ (EGT).

`Heather Goldsby <http://www.heatherjgoldsby.com/>`__ will be giving a 30-minute introduction to `Avida <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida>`__ / `digital evolution <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_organism>`__.

`Randy Olson <http://www.randalolson.com>`__ will be giving a 20-minute introduction to embodied models of `artificial life <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life>`__.

Homework
===========

We will briefly go over the `Avida homework assignment <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/beacon-center/2013-intro-computational-science/blob/master/notebooks/hw6-The%20evolutionary%20origin%20of%20complex%20features.ipynb>`__.
