Wed, Nov 13, 2013 -- More plotting, data wrangling, and coding an evolutionary digital model
###########################################################

Homework 6 solutions
===========

We will briefly go over the solution to the `Avida homework assignment <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/beacon-center/2013-intro-computational-science/master/notebooks/hw6-The%2520evolutionary%2520origin%2520of%2520complex%2520features.ipynb>`__.

We will cover how to wrangle and plot the data after Avida has generated it. Video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyBI6arfMzs

We will also discuss the biological implications of the experiment as a class.

Model in Homework 7
===========

We will walk through the model in the `evolutionary digital modeling homework <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/beacon-center/2013-intro-computational-science/master/notebooks/hw7-Animal%20Foraging%20and%20the%20Evolution%20of%20Goal-Directed%20Cognition.ipynb>`__. You will be working with this model for your homework for the rest of the semester.
