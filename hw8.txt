Homework 8 (due Tuesday, November 26, at 11:59pm PST)
#####################################################

1. IPythonBlocks
----------

See the `IPythonBlocks introduction <http://2013-cse801.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hw1.html#work-through-some-programming-exercises>`__ from earlier in the semester if you need a refresher for IPythonBlocks.

2. Tutorial videos
----------

I've prepared several tutorial videos for this homework.

Working with the evolutionary model: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXKJQHaFWnU

Saving data to a file in Python: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irnj19jz8uI

Computing and plotting estimated 95% confidence intervals in Python: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N5Uo3XOTNQ

3. Final project
----------

Download the `evolutionary digital modeling homework notebook <http://raw.github.com/beacon-center/2013-intro-computational-science/master/notebooks/hw7-Animal%20Foraging%20and%20the%20Evolution%20of%20Goal-Directed%20Cognition.ipynb>`__. You will be using the model from this notebook for the final project.

For the first week of the final project, you will break into groups of up to 4 and decide as a group on an interesting (and feasible^) extension of the model. You may work alone on the final project, but I do not recommend it. Once you've decided on a group, assign a group representative. They will be the one to send in all homework submissions and reports for the group.

I expect your group to formulate a testable hypothesis, with alternative hypotheses, that the extension of this model will explore. You should also begin running the model in replicate and gathering data to explore your hypotheses. I do not expect you to have all of the data gathered by next Wednesday, but I do expect to see reasonable progress.

Deliverables for this week should include:

* List of everyone in the group (including email addresses)

* Brief explanation of the hypotheses your group is exploring and why

* Code for the extended model

* Any progress on data gathering/analysis so far

Turn in your progress report via the usual method (commit a notebook to Github + email me the nbviewer link). Be sure to include the data you used to generate any graphs.
