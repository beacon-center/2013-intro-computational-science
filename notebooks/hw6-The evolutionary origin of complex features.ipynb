      ">Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, including its intertwined hypotheses of descent with modification and adaptation by natural selection, is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time. From the outset, Darwin realized that \u201corgans of extreme perfection and complication\u201d, such as the eye, posed a difficulty for his theory. Such features are much too complex to appear de novo, and he reasoned that they must evolve by incremental transitions through many intermediate states, sometimes undergoing changes in function. There now exists substantial evidence concerning the evolution of complex features that supports Darwin\u2019s general model. Nonetheless, it is difficult to provide a complete account of the origin of any complex feature owing to the extinction of intermediate forms, imperfection of the fossil record, and incomplete knowledge of the genetic and developmental mechanisms that produce such features.\n",
