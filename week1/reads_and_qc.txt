Understanding Read Formats and Quality Controlling Data
=======================================================

Note: there are generic instructions for doing quality control at the
`khmer-protocols Web site
<https://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__.  These should work for
most Illumina data sets, even those consisting of multiple files.
Below, we've done a bit of a shorthand because we only have a small
data set to filter.

The fastq Format
````````````````
After spending weeks, nay, months of time on designing your study and planning your
bioinformatics goals (right?), you finally get the email from you sequencing
center: they have your data! You get a link to an ftp server and some login information,
and are presented with a list of files. But what are these formats?

Most commonly, you'll get your data in fastq format. fastq is a really simple
way of representing sequence in plain text which is understood by pretty much
every piece of bioinformatics software. A fastq file can contain anywhere from
one to billions of sequences, and is usually used for reads before they have been
assembled. A faux example of the format is::

    @read1
    +
    ATCGTAGCTAGCTAGCT
    +
    DH<F4CFDFH@FHIBBE
    
The first line is the name of the sequence; there is no set format for this, though
most of the big centers like the NCBI have set standards. This is followed by
a '+', a line break, and then the sequence itself, which can be either nucleotide or protein.
Then we have another line break, a '+', and a line break, followed by the quality line.

The quality line is the part of the format which is not immediately obvious. This line follows
what is known as the phred format. Each ASCII character corresponds to a base,
and its integer mapping is used in the equation :math:`P = 10^{-Q / 10}`,
where :math:`Q` is the phred score and :math:`P` is the probability that the base
is incorrectly called.

The counterpart to fastq is fasta, which is essentially fastq without the quality
score and a minor formatting change::

    >read1
    ATCGTAGGTAGGATATA
    
fasta is usually output by assembly programs, and can be used if data has already
been quality controlled and needs to be a more manageable size. However, if you're
not sure what preprocessing steps your data has been through, but you have fasta
instead of fastq, you'd be well-off to make sure of what those steps were.


Getting the Data
````````````````
Now that you know a little about the format, let's get some data. The data set
we'll be using is from everyone's favorite bacterium, E. coli. We'll use the
command line tool curl to download it to our Amazon machines::

    cd /mnt
    mkdir ecoli
    cd ecoli
    curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR390/SRR390202/SRR390202_1.fastq.gz
    curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR390/SRR390202/SRR390202_2.fastq.gz

The data came from `this <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22522955>`__ study,
if you're interested.

To take a quick look at the files, use less::

    less SRR390202_1.fastq.gz

Hit 'q' to quit less.

These reads are compressed with gzip to save some space, and are in two files, 
because they are paired -- the first read in ``SRR390202_1.fastq.gz``
is paired with the first read in ``SRR390202_2.fastq.gz`` and so on. Some programs
prefer paired reads to be interleaved, that is, in the same file alternating between
the first and second read pair. Many programs also require the name field in
the fasta/q to explicitly state which part of a pair a read is with a /1 or /2; for example,
in an interleaved file, you might have::

    @SRR390202.1 M10_0139:1:2:18915:1321/1
    ATCAAGAAAGATTTTAACAGCATTGAC
    +
    ECCFFFDDHGHFDHJJJJIGIDIJJJJ
    @SRR390202.1 M10_0139:1:2:18915:1321/2
    GTTCATAGTGACAAGGTAATATTTGTC
    +
    FDFFFFHHGGIJIF?CIGJJGI@FEFH
    
Naturally, because this is a standard, almost every program has a different way of
doing it. So, be sure to double check the pairing format in your data!


Getting the Dependencies
````````````````````````

Before we can work with our data, we need to grab a few more dependencies. We'll download screed, which is
a simple python module for parsing fasta files developed by our lab at MSU::

    pip install screed

And then khmer, which is a Python interface to a really fast (and awesome) piece
of software for counting k-mers, also developed by our lab (more on that later)::

    cd /usr/local/share
    git clone https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer.git
    cd khmer
    git checkout 2013-caltech-cemi
    make

Now that we've downloaded and built khmer, we'll add it to the system's python
PATH so that our scripts know where to find it::

    echo 'export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/share/khmer/python' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

Get Trimmomatic, which is used for adapter removal and quality filtering::

    curl -O http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/Trimmomatic-0.30.zip
    unzip Trimmomatic-0.30.zip
    cd Trimmomatic-0.30/
    cp trimmomatic-0.30.jar /usr/local/bin
    cp -r adapters /usr/local/share/adapters

And then fastx, and its dependencies, which is another tool for quality filtering::

    cd /root
    curl -O http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/libgtextutils-0.6.1.tar.bz2
    tar xjf libgtextutils-0.6.1.tar.bz2
    cd libgtextutils-0.6.1/
    ./configure && make && make install

    cd /root
    curl -O http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/fastx_toolkit-0.0.13.2.tar.bz2
    tar xjf fastx_toolkit-0.0.13.2.tar.bz2
    cd fastx_toolkit-0.0.13.2/
    ./configure && make && make install

And finally install FastQC::

    cd /usr/local/share
    curl -O http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.10.1.zip
    unzip fastqc_v0.10.1.zip
    chmod +x FastQC/fastqc

Assessing your Data with FastQC
```````````````````````````````

Before you go wildly charging at your data with trimmers and filters,
it's always a good idea to know what your data looks like ahead of
time. The program we will use for this is FastQC, which parses the
quality information from all the reads and produces handy charts and
statistics::

    cd /mnt/ecoli
    mkdir /root/Dropbox/fastqc_before
    /usr/local/share/FastQC/fastqc *.fastq.gz -o /root/Dropbox/fastqc_before

(Before you run this, you'll need to have Dropbox working -- see :doc:`amazon/installing-dropbox`.)

This will take ~15-20 minutes.  Once it's done, you'll have some results
in your Dropbox folder -- on your local computer, go find your Dropbox
directory and look for the fastqc_report.html files -- you should have
two of them, one under the folder 'SRR390202_1_fastqc' and the other
under 'SRR390202_2_fastqc'.

Trimming Your Data
``````````````````

Based on the FastQC report for the reads, we should probably quality
trim them.  Although there aren't any flagged overrepresented
sequences, it's good practice to filter for adapters as well, which
can confound assemblers. Trimmomatic can both filter adapters and
quality trim, though we'll only use it for adapter removal here::

    mkdir trim
    cd trim
    java -jar /usr/local/bin/trimmomatic-0.30.jar PE ../SRR390202_1.fastq.gz ../SRR390202_2.fastq.gz s1_pe s1_se s2_pe s2_se ILLUMINACLIP:/usr/local/share/adapters/TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10
    
fastx is an alternative which performs many of the same functions as
Trimmomatic.  We'll use it for quality filtering; the following flags
direct its fastq_quality_filter module to keep reads if 50% of the
bases have a quality score over 30::
    
    /usr/local/share/khmer/scripts/interleave-reads.py s1_pe s2_pe > combined.fq
    fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 -i combined.fq > combined-trim.fq
    fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 -i s1_se > s1_se.filt

We also interleaved the reads in the previous block, as fastx requires
it. We'll now separate out the reads which had their pair thrown out
into their own file, combine them with the output of Trimmomatic, and
compress the results::

    /usr/local/share/khmer/scripts/extract-paired-reads.py combined-trim.fq
    cat combined-trim.fq.se s1_se.filt | gzip -9c > ../SRR390202.se.qc.fq.gz
    gzip -9c combined-trim.fq.pe > ../SRR390202.pe.qc.fq.gz

Finally, move up a directory and get rid of all the unneeded intermediate files::

    cd ../
    rm -fr trim
    
Reassess Data Quality
`````````````````````

Once the reads have been quality-controlled, we should check to make
sure that our measures were actually helpful::

    mkdir /root/Dropbox/fastqc_after
    /usr/local/share/FastQC/fastqc SRR390202.pe.qc.fq.gz SRR390202.se.qc.fq.gz -o /root/Dropbox/fastqc_after
    
Check the output the same way as above.
